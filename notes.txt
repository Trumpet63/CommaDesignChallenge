note at the top of the screen that it's designed to display the screen at native resolution
try getting the controls to appear to the right, rather than below?
make all my components draggable?
figure out the right bWidth, it's certainly not 1000?
proper resolution scaling?
steering wheel diagram?
make a change log display?
apply smoothing to the bar movement?

What options do I want the user to have?
Toggle the two throttle bars being together on the same side, or being on opposite sides
  there are two ways to be on the same side, one way to be on the opposite side
Toggle of the throttle bars are on left/right or top/bottom
  there are only two reasonable options for top/bottom in general
Rotate between all the different styles for the throttle bars
Toggle the colors of the throttles - actually no, they're colored that way for a reason
Position the steering bar automatically

Position options:
two on the left
one on each side
two on the right
two on the top
two on the bottom

When I switch between a left/right position to a top/bottom one, I'll have to map the
style, since the two have different sets of styles
